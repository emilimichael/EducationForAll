        <h2>Education Around The World</h2>
        <p> In recent years, more children are enrolled in school than ever before, majority of countries try to
          encourage children to advance past primary school to continue their education. Yet, even if the number of
          students who quit after primary school is very low, the actual number of students who attend secondary
          school and above varies greatly from country to country.<br><br> Bellow you will see various facts regarding
          the state of education around the world and factors such as gender and the state of the country itself. </p>

        <h3>Gender Inequality</h3>
        <p>An estimate of 129 millions girls worldwide remain out of school and face multiple barriers to education.
          Globally, 9 in 10 girls complete their primary education, but only 3 in 4 complete their lower secondary
          education. In low-income countries, less than two thirds of girls complete their primary education, and only
          1 in 3 completes lower secondary school. <br><br>This problem occurs most frequently in the Arab States, in
          central Asia and in Southern and Western Asia and is principally explained by the cultural and traditional
          privileged treatment given to males. Girls are destined to work in the family home, whereas boys are
          entitled to receive an education. </p>

        <h3>Illiteracy </h3>
        <p>According to World Atlas, the sub-saharan region has the highest illiteracy rate in the world. An estimated
          40.1% of the population is illiterate. Fourteen out of the 22 countries in the world with literacy rates
          below 60% are in Sub-Saharan Africa and only only 64% of primary and 50% of secondary school teachers have
          the minimum required training, and this proportion has been declining since 2000. <br><br>In South-Asia and
          Arab States the illiteracy rate is 31.3% and 26.6% respectively, whereas in Europe and Central Asia it was
          1.8% in 2016. </p>

        <h3>Inclusivity</h3>
        <p>Inclusivity means that all children, including those with disabilities and speakers of minority languages,
          get the chance to go to school, be in a classroom. <br><br>Yet, children with disabilities are often
          overlooked and are more likely to stay out of school.</p>
        <p class="incl"> In low and lower-middle income countries, around 40% of children with disabilities are out of
          school at primary level and 55% at lower secondary level <br><br>Approximately one billion people in the
          world are living with a disability, with at least 1 in 10 being children and 80% living in lower-income
          countries. <br><br>The literacy rate for adults with disabilities is 3%. For women with disabilities the
          literacy rate is even lower, at 1% </p>
        <p>Inclusive education is the most effective way to give all children a fair chance to go to school, learn and
          develop the skills they need to thrive.</p>

        <h3>Low-Income Countries </h3>
        <p> In an ideal world, primary education would be universal and publicly financed, and all children would be
          able to attend school regardless of their parents' ability or willingness to pay. <br><br>Despite
          considerable progress over the past two decades, however, school attendance in the world's poorest countries
          is by no means universal.</p>
        <p class="incl"> 91% of primary school-age children in low-income countries will not achieve minimum
          proficiency levels in reading and the rate is 87% in math compared to 5% and 8% respectively in high-income
          countries. <br><br> 93% of secondary school-age adolescents in low-income countries will not achieve minimum
          proficiency levels in reading compared to 27% in high-income countries. Source: UIS Fact Sheet 46, p.11
          <br><br> Low- and middle-income countries spend 2% of their GDP each year on education costs that do not
          lead to learning. <br><br> Approximately 1 in 4 young people in low and lower-middle income countries is
          illiterate. <br><br>An estimated 53% of children in low- and middle-income countries cannot read
          proficiently by age 10.
