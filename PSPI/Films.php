            <p class="description">Race to Nowhere is a 2009 top Netflix documentary film written by Maimone Attia and directed by
                Vicki Abeles and Jessica Congdon. Part of the powe rof Race to Nowhere is in its personal story. The film came into
                being after director Vicki Abeles discovered that the pressures of school, homework, tutoring and extracurricular
                activities were making her middle-school daughter physically sick. The notion that her daughter – a seemingly normal
                teenager – had been diagnosed with a stress-induced illness was a painful wake-up call and a catalyst for change.</p>

            <p class="description">Beyond Measure follows three different sets of teachers and students as
                they grapple with the realities of public education and try to enact meaningful change in their own
                education communities. As in her previous film, the popular documentary Race to Nowhere,
                director Vicki Abeles focuses on the stress caused by high-stakes testing and how alternative teaching methods,
                such as project-based learning, can alleviate that stress.</p>

            <p class="description">Although the dropout rate is steadily declining, 7% of high school students dropped out in the year 2014. This student-produced film offers much-needed insight into how
                and why students leave school, and what might motivate them to stay. Over the course of one year, student co-directors Precious Lambert and Leah Edwards interviewed three of their friends about their lives after dropping out, bringing an important student voice component to the conversation around school retention.

                Part documentary and part social-justice campaign, Teach Us All revisits the violent resistance to the desegregation of Central High
                in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1957. Sixty years after a group of African American students (known as the Little Rock Nine) defied racism
                and hatred to attend an all-white school, Teach Us All takes us back to the city where it all began.
                The modern-day Little Rock school district once again faces upheaval as it navigates a recent state takeover and wrestles with
                civil rights issues facing schools across the nation. Educational inequality is at the forefront of this compelling documentary,
                leaving viewers with the lesson that some history is less settled than many would like to believe.

            <p class="description">Getting to school can be more complicated (and far more dangerous) than simply getting into a school bus. For these children (Jackson from Kenya, Carlito from Argentina ,Zahira from Morrocco, and Samuel from India) it involves riding a horse, wading rivers, crossing treacherous mountain paths or traversing African savannas populated by lions and elephants. Yet, their minds aren’t concerned with the dangers on their way to school. The only thing that worries them is getting there on time. On the Way to School will make you question all the things you take for granted.

            <p class="description">As he follows a handful of promising kids through a system that inhibits, rather than encourages, academic growth, Guggenheim undertakes an exhaustive review of public education, surveying “drop-out factories” and “academic sinkholes,” methodically dissecting the system and its seemingly intractable problems. However, embracing the belief that good teachers make good schools, Guggenheim offers hope by exploring innovative approaches taken by education reformers and charter schools that have—in reshaping the culture—refused to leave their students behind.

            <p class="description">Please Vote for Me takes us inside an elementary school classroom in Wuhan, China, where students are preparing for arguably the biggest event of the year: electing their class official. Remember, the democratic process is something of a rarity in Communist China, so watching these fledging pols figure it out as they go is half the fun. The real meat of the film, though, is in its examination of what success in the classroom means for these kids as well as their parents (many of whom are every bit as invested in the outcome of the election as the candidates themselves).

            <p class="description">In September 2010, 16-year-old Palestinian refugee Mohamad Fahed arrives at London’s Heathrow airport and is taken to Britain‘s most prestigious private school, Eton College.
                Mohamad’s hopes to become a genetic engineer – a once-distant dream as a boy growing up in the Al Rashidieh Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon. Winning an all-expenses-paid scholarship to the college, however, opens up his life in ways he cannot yet imagine.
                Al Jazeera’s Witness follows Mohamad through his first year in Eton as he adopts the mantle of a public schoolboy in an unknown environment while dealing with inevitable homesickness and undertaking the process of making new friends among the privileged college students.
